# 🌍 About Me
 👋 Hi, I'm Mubarak Mohamed — a junior cloud computing engineer based in Hargeisa, Somaliland.

📘 I’ve earned certifications in Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) and Azure Administrator (AZ-104), with a strong focus on resource management and infrastructure operations.

### 🧪 My hands-on experience includes building and documenting three key labs:
- Azure Virtual Network (vNet) Creation
- Azure vNet Peering Configuration
- Azure Resource Tagging and Filtering

#### 🔍 I’m passionate about learning by doing—creating reproducible labs, troubleshooting real-world scenarios, and documenting workflows that strengthen my technical foundation.
